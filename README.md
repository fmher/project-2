## Project Idea

I was thinking of creating a pokemon fan blog. You can favorite up to 6 pokemon on your profile and explain why you choose them. It can be why you like them or that you choose them because that team set up is broken. You can talk to people, write random status updates, view other peoples statuses, respond to statuses. Talk to other people who like pokemon as well. It will be like a little community. 

## API link

https://pokeapi.co/ 
This link allows to recieve a good amount of data on pokemon.

## User approach

People who like pokemon casusally or competitively would come join this blog to talk to others who feel the same way. This app would target people who only wants to talk about pokemon. Weather it is an update about pokemon, pokemon strategies, or about the anime.
